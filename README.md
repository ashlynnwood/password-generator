## Usage
To navigate this password generator, a user can click on the "generate password" button located in the middle of the page. This will provide the user with a series of prompts to figure out what they want to set for their password criteria. The user will be asked how many characters they would like the password to be, and if they would like to include special, numeric, lower case, and upper case characters. Users must choose a password length between 8-128 characters, and choose at least one type of character to be included. After they reach the end of the prompts, their newly generated password will display in the password box.
